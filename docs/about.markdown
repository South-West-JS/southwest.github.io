South West JS has a long history with JavaScript in Bristol.  It all started with a stuttering talk on Meteor back in April 2012 under the name of Southville JS.  As the group grew, there was a need to be more inclusive of those living north of the river, which led to Bristol JS.

As they they say, the rest is history and 13 years later, South West JS exists to provides a platform for professionals in the industry to share their development knowledge and expertise with their peers. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone can learn and grow together.
